Run All Migrations
To apply all pending migrations and update the database schema to match the current state of your migration files, run:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
6. Check Migration Status
To check the status of your migrations (i.e., which migrations have been applied and which are pending), use:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:status
7. Undo Migrations (Optional)
If you need to undo the last migration or all migrations, you can use:

Undo the last migration:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
Undo all migrations:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all
8. Seed Data (Optional)
If you also have seed data to insert, you can run seeders after migrating:

Create Seeder Files:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name your-seeder-name
Run Seeders:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
Undo Seeders (Optional):

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all
By following these steps, youâ€™ll be able to manage your database schema changes and seed data effectively with Sequelize CLI.
